Telegram description: This bot generates random animal names and provides a picture of it.

## About
On such platforms as bugs.telegram.org or contest.com you can find users with hilarious names and cute profile pictures of some animals. Those things are generated randomly. I found it interesting to create a generator of these kind of names and pictures.

## Creating your bot
1) Create your own bot using [Bot Father](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy your brand-new bot's token.
2) Paste the token in `config.js`. Replace `process.env.TOKEN` (second line) to your token.
3) The bot uses MongoDB. If you use another database providing platform, you should rewrite the code a little bit. However, if you use MongoDB as well as me, just replace `process.env.DATABASE` to your database URL in `config.js` (third line).
4) Once you've done all those steps, you can launch your bot and enjoy it!
